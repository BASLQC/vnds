Installation:
    Extract the .tar.gz onto the root of the SD card so the path is 
    /vnds/. To install a visual novel, extract the tar.gz in /vnds/novels, so
    it has its own folder (ie. /vnds/novels/tsukihime). Sound files should
    end up in /vnds/novels/<game folder>/sound/.

NOTICE:
    * any save prior to version 1.3.1 needs to be ran though the sav2xml.py
        utility in the tools/ folder. requires python(http://python.org) to run
    * alternatively: http://digital-haze.net/files/vnds/fixsave.php

Running:
    Should be easy enough

Troubleshooting:
    * Make sure the path is correct
    * If you run it and you get stuck at a white screen, launch it with an
        alternative launcher, such as dsorganize or dschannels.
