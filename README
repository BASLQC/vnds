NOTE: This repo is solely an archive of the final version 1.4.9 by anonNL made in 2011, in the aim of defining the least common denominator for a working implementation. https://web.archive.org/web/20111207074836/http://digital-haze.net/files/vnds/vnds/vnds-1.4.9.tar.gz

A maintained version for Nintendo DS can be found below:

https://github.com/ds-homebrew/vnds

Note that anonNL indicates that jake's contributions starting with 1.5.0 (lost) are a separate branch based on 1.4.7 (lost)
so these commits are actually older and precede the true latest version 1.4.9 which merges changes from jake's 1.5.3 and 
provides newer patches, confusingly. (as shown by the crossed out links and the 1.4.9 ChangeLog) https://web.archive.org/web/20140218222855/digital-haze.net/projects/vnds.html

Additional documentation is available in the manual folder

Installation:
    Extract the .tar.gz onto the root of the SD card so the path is 
    /vnds/. To install a visual novel, extract the tar.gz in /vnds/novels, so
    it has its own folder (ie. /vnds/novels/tsukihime). Sound files should
    end up in /vnds/novels/<game folder>/sound/.

NOTICE:
    * any save prior to version 1.3.1 needs to be ran though the sav2xml.py
        utility in the tools/ folder. requires python(http://python.org) to run
    * alternatively: http://digital-haze.net/files/vnds/fixsave.php

Running:
    Should be easy enough

Troubleshooting:
    * Make sure the path is correct
    * If you run it and you get stuck at a white screen, launch it with an
        alternative launcher, such as dsorganize or dschannels.
